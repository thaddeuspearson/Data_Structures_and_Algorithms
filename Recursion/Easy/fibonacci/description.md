# Fibonacci Number

## Description

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, typically starting from 0 and 1. That is:

- F(0) = 0  
- F(1) = 1  
- F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1

Your task is to implement a function that returns the nth Fibonacci number.

You may assume `n` is a non-negative integer.

## Example

```
Input:
n = 6

Output: 
8
```
