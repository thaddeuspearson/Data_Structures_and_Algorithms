# Bubble Sort

## Description

Given an array of integers, implement the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort the array in ascending order.  
Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until no swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted.

You are required to modify the input array in-place.

## Example

```
Input:
    array = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]

Output:
    [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]
```
