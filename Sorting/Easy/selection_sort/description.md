# Selection Sort

## Description

Given an array of integers, implement the **Selection Sort** algorithm to sort the array in ascending order. Selection Sort is an in-place comparison-based sorting algorithm. It divides the input list into two parts: the sublist of items already sorted, which is built up from left to right, and the sublist of items remaining to be sorted that occupy the rest of the list. The algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted sublist and swaps it with the leftmost unsorted element.

Your task is to write a function that takes an array of integers and sorts it using the selection sort algorithm. You must modify the array in-place and return it.

## Example

```
Input:
nums = [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]

Output: 
[11, 12, 22, 25, 64]
```
