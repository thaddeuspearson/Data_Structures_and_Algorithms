# Insertion Sort

## Description

Given an array of integers, nums, sort the array in ascending order using the insertion sort algorithm.

Insertion sort works by iterating through the array and, at each iteration, removing one element from the input data, finding the location it belongs within the sorted list, and inserting it there. It continues until no elements remain in the unsorted portion.

You must implement this algorithm manually without relying on built-in sort functions.

## Example

```
Input:
    nums = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]

Output:
    [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]
```
