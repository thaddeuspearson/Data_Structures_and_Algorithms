# Spiral Matrix

## Description

Given an `m x n` matrix, return all the elements of the matrix in spiral order. The traversal should start at the top-left corner of the matrix and proceed clockwise, visiting each element exactly once in a spiral pattern: first moving right, then down, then left, then up, and repeating this pattern as necessary until all elements are visited.

## Example

```
Input:
    matrix = [
        [1, 2, 3],
        [4, 5, 6],
        [7, 8, 9]
    ]

Output:
    [1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 7, 4, 5]
```
