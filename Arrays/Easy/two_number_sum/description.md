# Two Number Sum

## Description

Given an array of integers and a target integer, find **two numbers** in the array such that they add up to the target.

You may assume that each input has **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the same element twice.

Return the two numbers in any order

## Example

```
Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9  
Output: [2, 7]
```
