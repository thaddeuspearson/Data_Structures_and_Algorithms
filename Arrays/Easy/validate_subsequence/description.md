# Validate Subsequences

## Description

Given two arrays, `array` and `sequence`, check whether the `sequence` is a subsequence of the `array`.

A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that appear in the same order as they do in the array, but not necessarily consecutively. For example, `[1, 3, 4]` is a subsequence of `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, while `[2, 4, 1]` is not.

Return **true** if `sequence` is a subsequence of `array`, and **false** otherwise.

## Example

```
Input:
    array = [5, 1, 22, 25, 6, -1, 8, 10]
    sequence = [1, 6, -1, 10]

Output: 
    True
