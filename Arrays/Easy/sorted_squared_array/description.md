# Sorted Squared Array

## Description

Given a **non-empty** `array` of integers sorted in **non-decreasing order**, create a new array of the same length containing the **squares of each number**, also sorted in **non-decreasing order**.

Since the original array can contain both negative and positive numbers, squaring the elements might change their order. Your task is to correctly compute the squares and return them in sorted order.

## Example

```
Input:
    array = [-7, -3, 1, 9, 22, 30]

Output:
    [1, 9, 49, 81, 484, 900]
```
