# Group Anagrams

## Description

Given a list of `strings`, group the strings that are anagrams of each other.  
Two strings are anagrams if they consist of the same characters in any order, with the same number of each character.

Return a list of groups, where each group is a list that contains words that are anagrams of one another.

## Example

```
Input:
    strings = ["listen", "silent", "enlist", "stone", "tones", "notes", "apple"]

Output:
    [["listen", "silent", "enlist"], ["stone", "tones", "notes"], ["apple"]]
```
