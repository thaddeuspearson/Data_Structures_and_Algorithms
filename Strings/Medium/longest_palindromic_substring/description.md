# Longest Palindromic Substring

## Description

Given a `string`, find and return the longest substring that reads the same forwards and backwards.  
A palindrome is a sequence of characters that remains unchanged when reversed.

Assume there is at most one longest palindromic substring.  
The string can include letters, digits, spaces, or symbols.

## Example

```
Input:
    string = "noonracecarnoon"

Output:
    "noonracecarnoon"
```
