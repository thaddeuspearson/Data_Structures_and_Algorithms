# Minimum Characters Needed for Words

## Description

Given an array of `words`, return an array containing the minimum characters needed to be able to form every word in the input array at least once.

Each character should appear in the result as many times as its **maximum frequency in any single word**.  
The order of characters in the result does not matter.

## Example

```
Input:
    words = ["bella", "label", "roller"]

Output:
    ["e", "l", "l", "a", "b", "o", "r", "r"]
```
