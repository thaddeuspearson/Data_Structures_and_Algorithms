# Valid Palindrome

## Description

Given a `string`, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward after removing non-alphanumeric characters and converting all letters to lowercase.

Return `True` if the string is a palindrome, or `False` otherwise.

## Example

```
Input:
    string = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"

Output:
    True
```
