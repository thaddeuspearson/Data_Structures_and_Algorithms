# Common Characters

## Description

Given an array of strings `words`, return a list of all characters that show up in each word within the array (excluding duplicates).

For example, if a character appears more than once every word, it should appear once in the final result.

Characters can appear in any order in the output.

## Example

```
Input:
    words = ["bella", "label", "roller"]

Output:
    ["e", "l"]
```
